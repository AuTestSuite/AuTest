Reusable Gold Testing System
===================================

Resuable Gold testing system, or autest for short, is a testing system targeted toward gold file, command line process testing.

Goals
----------------------------------

* Easy to write and add tests
* Extensible system to allow: 
 * Adding new functionality for testing your application
 * Batch commands as a new function to make it easier to write tests
 * Define custom report outputs
* Percise as possible error messages to make it easy to see what is wrong fast
* Sandbox to make it easy to see what failed and reproduce out of test system
* Flexibale gold file synatx to make it easier to ignore text that is not important
* Run on python 2 or 3

Non-Goals
----------------------------------

The Resuable Gold testing system is not about making another unit testing framework.
